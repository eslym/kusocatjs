# @kusocat/core

Just a random shit for building web application in bun, not framework just random shit.

## Install

```shell
bun add @kusocat/core
```

## Why this name?

```
ME: What name should I name this?
Somebody: KusoCat.js
ME: Ok
```

## Why this package?

To utilize the feature which bun can run and debug typescript out of the box, it does make development with typescript **much much much better**.

If you wonder why this is not a framework, the answer is there are too many choices in javascript world.
This package is just trying to make dependency injection easier (inpired by Laravel).

## Usage
